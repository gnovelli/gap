- Workload class in GridSim for GAP (DONE)
- SpaceShared class in GridSim for GAP
-- See ResGridletList
-- See AllocPolicy.griletMigrate
- Handle multiple VOs
- Complete clean grid management by agents
-- Review combinations (see previous notes) and their possible impact on XSD
   optional agents section
- Create factories for XML data
-- Refactor code to include a create factory method in top net.sf.gap.xml.types
-- Debug and fix, if needed, the code
-- Topology
-- VOs
-- Scenario as many VOs
--- VO contents
-- So, given an XML input we instantiate entities
-- VOs created must be abstract in order to attach to them other things like:
--- Agents, Agent Platform, Users, ...
-- Given such abstract VOs, developer has to define:
--- Agents' behaviours
--- Users's behaviours
--- Measures
--- How to handle agents and users
--- Other simulation parameters
--- Start simulation
--- Handle measures

TraMA
- Parameters related to the hibernation method used (TraMA)
-- Bytecode overhead
--- Overhead in program dimensions
--- Characterize with a proper distribution (i.e. normal distribution)
-- Execution overhead
--- Characterize with a proper distribution (i.e. normal distribution)
--- Associate it with cyclomatic complexity of code
--- Define possible simplified execution graphs of code
- Scenario A - Scenario TraMA and Scenario Normal of B executed separately
- Scenario B
-- We have two VOs (TraMAVO, NormalVO) with
--- identical underlying topologies
--- identical grid elements
--- identical background workloads
---- Find a way to modify per grid element background workload with deteterministic events
---- Find a way to specify in XML such workloads or at least to programmatically relate them to XML scenario
---- No network background traffic
-- Users and Jobs
--- There are 2*N users (TraMAUser1..TramaUserN,NormalUser1..NormalUserN)
--- Users are connected in the same way to their VOs
--- Users submits the same jobs to their VOs
-- Behaviour of VOs
--- NormalVO
---- 1. Normal Submission of jobs
---- 2. Submissions to agents but not mobile
--- TraMAVO
---- Agents compute at discrete intervals the value of an utility function
----- Parameters
------ Duration of such intervals 
------- Constant and equally spaced Duration
------- Dynamic through a publish/subscribe monitoring about grid element load
-------- Grid Element provides such feature
-------- Agent when reachs such grid element subscribes to such load monitoring feature for each host of 
         such ge an neighboorhood ges
--------- Load thresholds
---------- [0..a[ [a..b] ]b..1]
----------- when threshold becomes more than b ge sends a notification to agent about High_Load
----------- when threshold becomes less than a ge sends a notification to agent about Low_Load
----------- there is a mininum duration interval between two notifications to the same agent Minimum_Duration
----- Utility function U
------ values in [0..1]
------ Parameters
------- Load
------- TOTAL JOB MIPS
------- EXECUTED JOB MIPS
------- AGENT SIZE
-------- including save job state
-------- file input size
-------- produced output size
-------- final output size
------ when threshold value of utility function U is reached
------- agent has to move to another host if there is one with better value of U in its ge and neighboorhood ges
-------- if such better U is from an host of same ge agent migrates there and resumes
-------- otherwise it choosen host with lower value of distance*U*alfa+cost*beta
- Comparison between such VOs to know if TraMA solution is better
-- Measures
--- For each user and as an average for users of same VO
---- Total waiting times
---- Interval between first and last result from jobs
----- Jobs/sec
----- Total cost
----- Cost per MIPS
